✨ This version does a few things:  
- Looks like a **product landing page** inside GitHub.  
- Has **animations** (capsule header/footer + snake grid).  
- Clearly highlights your **plans, features, tech stack, and story**.  

👉 Do you want me to also create **separate GitHub folders** (like `/docs`, `/public/demo`, `/api`) so it looks like a **professional SaaS repo** instead of just a Next.js starter?
